IndusInd Bank recently disclosed significant discrepancies within its derivatives portfolio, which are estimated to negatively impact its net worth by approximately 2.35%. This revelation triggered a drop in the bank\'s stock price and raised concerns about its accounting practices. The unfolding of this issue appears to be closely linked to the implementation of the Reserve Bank of India\'s (RBI) updated regulations concerning the investment portfolios of commercial banks, specifically the Master Direction issued in 2023. The RBI has expressed confidence in the capital position and accounting practices of IndusInd Bank. While IndusInd Bank grapples with these discrepancies, other banks in the sector have seemingly avoided similar large-scale revelations, possibly due to differing accounting methodologies employed prior to the new regulations or the earlier recognition of potential losses. The RBI has responded to this situation by initiating a comprehensive review of derivative exposures across the banking sector. 

**1. Introduction** 

Derivative instruments have become integral to modern banking operations, and serve as essential tools for hedging against a variety of financial risks, including in foreign exchange rates and interest rates. The effective management and reporting of these complex financial instruments are of great importance for maintaining the stability, transparency, and overall health of financial institutions. Hence, the RBI is the key regulator related to this business, formulating and enforcing a set of regulations that govern how commercial banks must account for their derivative transactions. These regulations directly influence the reported financial position and performance of commercial banks. The disclosure by IndusInd Bank regarding significant discrepancies in its derivatives portfolio serves as an example of how evolving regulatory standards can impact previously established accounting practices.

**2. Derivative Accounting Regulations in India - The Landscape Before 2023** 

Prior to the comprehensive RBI Master Direction issued in 2023, the accounting and regulatory landscape for derivative transactions in India was shaped by a series of circulars, guidelines, and accounting standards. The RBI had issued the **A. P. (DIR Series) Circular No. 10 dated February 15, 2021** , which focused on the crucial aspect of margin requirements for derivative contracts entered into between Indian residents and non-residents. This circular, which was later superseded, aimed to mitigate counterparty risk in these transactions by establishing rules for the posting and collection of margins. While not directly addressing the core accounting treatment of derivatives, it highlighted the RBI\'s ongoing commitment to regulating derivative activities and managing associated risks. 

The **Master Direction -- Risk Management and Inter-Bank Dealings dated July 5, 2016**, as amended , provided a framework for the trading of non-deliverable derivative contracts (NDDCs). This direction permitted Authorised Dealer Category -- I (AD Cat-I) banks operating International Financial Services Centre (IFSC) Banking Units (IBUs) to offer NDDCs to persons resident outside India and subsequently to resident non-retail users for hedging purposes. This demonstrates the RBI\'s efforts to develop the onshore derivative market while establishing specific rules for these types of contracts. 

**Notification No. FEMA 1/2000-RB** and its subsequent amendments laid down the foundational principles for foreign exchange derivative contracts. These regulations covered a range of aspects, including the hedging of foreign currency exposures related to overseas direct investments, the treatment of contingent exposures arising from tender bids, and the operational guidelines for various derivative instruments such as forward contracts and options. Notably, these regulations also specified minimum eligibility criteria for banks wishing to deal in derivatives, emphasizing the need for a strong financial standing and risk management capabilities within these institutions. 

Complementing the RBI\'s regulatory pronouncements, the **ICAI\'s Guidance Note on Accounting for Derivative Contracts (Revised 2021)** played a pivotal role in shaping accounting practices. This non-mandatory guidance aimed to bring about uniformity in the recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of derivative contracts under Indian Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), particularly for those contracts not explicitly addressed by existing Accounting Standards (AS), such as foreign exchange forward contracts used for hedging highly probable forecasted transactions and cross-currency interest rate swaps . The Guidance Note advocated for the recognition of all derivative contracts on the balance sheet at fair value, with provisions for hedge accounting under specific circumstances . 

Prior to 2023, the derivative accounting practices adopted by Indian banks likely involved a combination of approaches . Mark-to-market valuation was generally applied to derivatives held for trading purposes, reflecting their fair value, based on prevailing market prices. However, for hedging activities, particularly internal hedging arrangements, some banks may have utilized different valuation methods, such as swap valuation or cost accounting . This potentially created a degree of divergence in accounting practices across the sector, especially concerning the treatment of internal derivative transactions.

**3. The RBI Master Direction 2023 on Investment Portfolio of Commercial Banks** 

The regulatory landscape for derivative accounting in India underwent a significant transformation with the issuance of the **\"Reserve Bank of India (Classification, Valuation and Operation of Investment Portfolio of Commercial Banks) Directions, 2023,\"** on September 12, 2023. These directions, which became effective for accounting periods commencing on or after April 1, 2024, represented a comprehensive overhaul of the existing norms governing how commercial banks classify, value, and operate their investment portfolios. The primary objective of this Master Direction was to align Indian regulatory guidelines with evolving global standards and best practices in investment accounting. Several key changes introduced by this Master Direction had a direct and significant impact on the accounting treatment of derivative instruments. 

Firstly, the regulations mandated a **mandatory classification of the entire investment portfolio**, explicitly including derivatives, into three distinct categories: Held to Maturity (HTM), Available for Sale (AFS), and Fair Value through Profit and Loss (FVTPL) . This requirement compelled banks to clearly categorize all their investments, including their derivative holdings, which directly dictates the subsequent valuation and accounting treatment in their financial statements. 

Secondly, the Master Direction placed a strong **emphasis on fair value accounting**, particularly for investments classified under the FVTPL category . This category typically includes instruments held for trading purposes, which would encompass a substantial portion of banks\' derivative portfolios. This signaled a clear regulatory push towards mark-to-market valuation for a broader range of derivative instruments, requiring banks to reflect the current market value of these assets and liabilities in their financial reporting. 

Thirdly, the directions introduced specific **guidelines for the recognition of Day 1 gains and losses** arising from Level 3 investments Level 3 investments are those whose valuation relies on unobservable inputs. The regulations stipulated that any Day 1 loss must be recognized immediately in the profit and loss account, while any Day 1 gain should be deferred and amortized over the life of the instrument. This provision aimed to curb the practice of inflating profits at the inception of complex derivative transactions and promoted a more conservative and prudent approach to recognizing gains. 

Fourthly, the Master Direction imposed **restrictions on the distribution of dividends** from net unrealized gains recognized in the profit and loss account due to the fair valuation of Level 3 derivative assets and liabilities. Furthermore, it mandated that such net unrealized gains must be deducted from the bank\'s Common Equity Tier 1 (CET 1) capital. These measures were designed to enhance the capital adequacy of banks by ensuring that dividend payouts are based on realized and sustainable profits and that regulatory capital is not inflated by unrealized gains on difficult-to-value derivatives. Fifthly, the Master Direction explicitly **required banks to comply with the requirements of the ICAI\'s Guidance Note on Accounting for Derivative Contracts (Revised 2021)**, with a specific exception for paragraph 63 of the said Guidance Note. This regulatory endorsement effectively integrated the accounting profession\'s guidance into the mandatory framework, promoting greater consistency and standardization in derivative accounting practices across the banking sector. 

Finally, the directions mandated the **categorization of the derivatives portfolio into three fair value hierarchy levels** (Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3) based on the observability of the inputs used for valuation and required banks to disclose this categorization in the notes to their financial statements. This disclosure requirement aimed to enhance transparency regarding the valuation of derivative holdings, allowing stakeholders to better assess the reliability and subjectivity involved in the reported values. The overarching objective of these regulatory changes was to foster the development of a more robust corporate bond market, encourage the use of derivatives primarily for hedging legitimate economic exposures, and ultimately strengthen the overall risk management framework within the Indian commercial banking sector.  

**4. IndusInd Bank: An Accounting Mismatch** 

Prior to the implementation of the RBI Master Direction 2023, IndusInd Bank had been utilizing internal derivative trades as a strategy to hedge its foreign currency borrowings and deposits . Instead of directly engaging in hedging transactions with external counterparties in the broader market, the bank\'s Asset Liability Management (ALM) desk would enter into internal swap contracts with its own trading desk. A critical aspect of this practice was the discrepancy in the valuation methodologies employed . External derivative trades, conducted with external parties, were accounted for using the mark-to-market (MTM) principle, meaning their value was adjusted daily to reflect prevailing market prices, and any changes in value were recognized in the profit and loss (P&L) statement. However, the internal derivative trades were valued using swap cost accounting or swap valuation methods, which did not necessarily reflect the daily market fluctuations in the same way. This difference in accounting treatment had the effect of potentially boosting the bank\'s reported Net Interest Income (NII) over the years because the costs associated with the internal hedges were not being fully and immediately reflected in the P&L statement . Instead, these costs were often accounted for in the asset book. 

Consequently, the actual trading losses associated with these hedging activities were suppressed and would only fully surface when the internal trades were unwound or reached maturity. The bank initiated a review of its derivatives portfolio following the RBI\'s issuance of the Master Direction in September 2023. This review, conducted around October-November 2023, led to the identification of these long-standing discrepancies in accounting. The bank subsequently reported an estimated adverse impact of approximately 2.35% on its net worth as of December 2024 , which amounted to around ₹1,600 crore on a post-tax basis and ₹2,100 crore before tax. The market reacted sharply to this disclosure, with IndusInd Bank\'s stock price experiencing a significant drop, reportedly around 27% in a single trading day . In response to the identified discrepancies and the market reaction, IndusInd Bank swiftly appointed an external agency, PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), to conduct an independent review and validation of its internal findings related to the derivatives portfolio.  

**5. How RBI\'s New Regulations Brought the Issue to Light** 

The implementation of the **RBI Master Direction 2023**, effective from April 1, 2024 , served as the primary catalyst that brought IndusInd Bank\'s long-standing accounting discrepancies to the forefront. The new regulations mandated a comprehensive review and reclassification of all banks\' investment portfolios, which included their derivative holdings. This requirement effectively eliminated the flexibility that might have previously allowed IndusInd Bank\'s practice of using swap valuation for internal hedges to persist without fully reflecting market realities in the profit and loss account. 

A key aspect of the Master Direction was the explicit requirement for banks to categorize their derivative portfolios according to the fair value hierarchy (Level 1, 2, and 3) and the overarching principle of **mark-to-market valuation** for instruments not classified as Held to Maturity (HTM) . This regulatory emphasis on reflecting current market values likely made IndusInd Bank\'s internal swap valuation method, which did not necessarily move in tandem with market fluctuations, non-compliant with the new norms. Consequently, the bank was compelled to recognize the accumulated unrealized losses that had been previously suppressed through its accounting treatment of internal hedges. 

Reports also suggest that IndusInd Bank faced challenges in fully adhering to the new RBI norms within the initially stipulated timeframe. While most banks reportedly complied by June 2024, IndusInd Bank sought an extension until September 2024 but ultimately failed to meet this revised deadline . This delay in compliance likely drew the attention of the RBI, potentially prompting the regulator to intervene and request a more thorough review and disclosure of the situation. Furthermore, the RBI directed IndusInd Bank to cease its practice of internal trades and hedging with effect from April 1, 2024 , coinciding with the implementation of the new Master Direction. This directive further underscores the regulatory shift away from internal hedging arrangements that might not adhere to the stringent valuation principles outlined in the new framework.   

**6. Why Other Banks Were Spared (Or So It Seems)** 

Several factors could explain why other commercial banks in India have not, thus far, reported similar large-scale accounting discrepancies in their derivatives portfolios following the implementation of the RBI Master Direction 2023. One possibility is that a significant portion of the banking sector may have already been following more conservative and market-oriented accounting practices for their derivative exposures, including internal hedging activities, even before the 2023 regulations came into force . If other banks were primarily using mark-to-market accounting for the majority of their derivative transactions, regardless of whether they were with external counterparties or internal desks, they would have been continuously recognizing any gains or losses in their profit and loss statements over time. 

In such a scenario, the new RBI regulations would have largely served to reinforce their existing practices rather than necessitating a significant one-time accounting adjustment. Another potential reason lies in the hedging strategies employed by different banks. Other institutions might have relied less heavily on internal swap arrangements with potentially differing valuation methods compared to external market valuations . Banks have various tools and strategies at their disposal to hedge their foreign exchange and other financial risks. If other banks predominantly utilized external hedging transactions with independent counterparties, their accounting would have naturally aligned with mark-to-market principles, as these external trades are typically valued based on prevailing market prices. Data from newspaper snippets indicates that banks are major participants on both the buy and sell sides of the over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives market in India, suggesting a significant level of external trading activity across the sector. It is also conceivable that some banks might have already identified and accounted for similar potential losses or valuation mismatches in their derivative portfolios during earlier periods, either through their internal audit processes or in response to previous regulatory guidance, albeit perhaps to a lesser extent or through different accounting adjustments. 

Banks are subject to regular internal and external audits, and any significant deviations from accepted accounting practices would ideally be identified and rectified before they escalate. Furthermore, banks that have seemingly avoided this type of crisis might have had more robust internal controls and risk management systems in place that were better equipped to detect and prevent such significant accounting mismatches from accumulating over several years. 

Finally, it is important to note that the RBI has initiated an industry-wide review of derivative exposures following the IndusInd Bank disclosure . This proactive step by the regulator suggests that while no other major incidents have been publicly reported thus far, the RBI is taking the IndusInd Bank situation seriously and is seeking to ensure that similar issues are not widespread across the banking system. This review will likely shed more light on the derivative accounting practices employed by various banks and could potentially uncover further instances of non-compliance or discrepancies.   

**7. The Role of ICAI\'s Guidance Note on Accounting for Derivative Contracts (Revised 2021)** 

The **ICAI\'s Guidance Note on Accounting for Derivative Contracts (Revised 2021)** played a significant role in shaping the accounting practices for derivative instruments in India prior to the RBI\'s 2023 Master Direction. This guidance aimed to provide a comprehensive framework for accounting for derivatives under Indian GAAP, with a particular focus on contracts that were not explicitly covered by Accounting Standard (AS) 11, which deals with The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates. The Guidance Note encompassed various derivative contracts, including foreign exchange forward contracts used for hedging highly probable forecasted transactions, cross-currency interest rate swaps, and other similar instruments employed for managing both foreign currency and interest rate risks.

A key provision of the Guidance Note was the requirement to recognize all derivative contracts on the balance sheet at **fair value** . It also provided detailed guidelines for the application of **hedge accounting**, which allows for specific accounting treatments when derivatives are designated and effective as hedges against identified risks. Regarding IndusInd Bank\'s situation, it is possible that the bank\'s accounting treatment for its internal swap arrangements was considered by them to be in compliance with the ICAI Guidance Note at the time. While the Guidance Note advocated for fair value accounting, it also provided a framework for hedge accounting, which might have allowed for some flexibility in how internal hedging arrangements were treated, particularly if the bank intended for the internal and external legs of the trade to converge in value by maturity. The interpretation of \"fair value\" and the specific criteria for applying hedge accounting could have been areas where IndusInd Bank\'s interpretation differed from what the RBI later deemed appropriate under the stricter guidelines of the 2023 Master Direction. 

The RBI\'s **2023 Master Direction** explicitly referenced and reinforced the ICAI Guidance Note (with a specific exception for paragraph 63) . This regulatory endorsement lent greater authority to the accounting principles outlined in the Guidance Note, potentially narrowing the scope for diverse interpretations that might have existed previously. By formally incorporating the ICAI\'s recommendations into the mandatory regulatory framework, the RBI effectively strengthened the accounting standards for derivatives in the banking sector, likely contributing to the need for IndusInd Bank to reassess its existing practices and ultimately recognize the accumulated losses.   

**8. Regulatory Response and Market Implications** 

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) responded promptly to IndusInd Bank\'s disclosure of accounting discrepancies. The central bank issued a statement reassuring depositors and the market about the bank\'s financial stability, highlighting its comfortable Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) of 16.46% and a Provision Coverage Ratio (PCR) of 70.20% as of December 31, 2024 . This immediate response aimed to prevent any potential panic or loss of confidence in the bank. 

Furthermore, the RBI initiated an **industry-wide review of the derivative exposures** of both private and public sector banks in India . This proactive regulatory action underscores the RBI\'s concern about potential systemic risks within the banking sector related to derivative accounting and its commitment to ensuring widespread compliance with the new regulations. The RBI also directed IndusInd Bank\'s board and management to complete all necessary remedial actions to address the identified discrepancies fully within the current quarter (Q4 FY25) and to ensure transparent and comprehensive disclosures to all stakeholders . 

In a move that suggests regulatory disapproval of the bank\'s handling of the situation, the RBI granted only a one-year extension to IndusInd Bank\'s Managing Director and CEO, Sumant Kathpalia, instead of the three-year term recommended by the bank\'s board . This decision is widely interpreted as being linked to the accounting discrepancies and broader concerns about governance and internal controls at the bank. The RBI has also increased its level of scrutiny on banks\' internal compliance with treasury operations, risk management practices, and hedging strategies, particularly concerning foreign currency liabilities . The IndusInd Bank crisis and the subsequent regulatory response are likely to have broader implications for the Indian banking sector. It is expected to lead to an increased industry-wide focus on transparency and accuracy in derivative accounting, stricter enforcement of RBI regulations related to investment portfolios and derivative transactions, and a potential move towards more standardized and conservative accounting practices across all banks . Banks will likely need to re-evaluate their internal hedging strategies and ensure that their accounting practices are fully aligned with the latest regulatory requirements and accounting standards.   

**9. Lessons Learned and the Path Forward** 

The IndusInd Bank crisis serves as a stark reminder of the critical importance of adhering to the latest regulatory guidelines and accounting standards, particularly in the complex area of derivative instruments. The **RBI Master Direction 2023 on Investment Portfolio of Commercial Banks** played a pivotal role in uncovering the long-standing accounting discrepancies at IndusInd Bank, highlighting the necessity of a robust and regularly updated regulatory framework. 

For the banking sector as a whole, this event underscores the need for proactive alignment of accounting practices with evolving regulations to ensure accurate and transparent financial reporting, thereby preventing potential financial shocks and reputational damage. Robust internal controls and effective audit mechanisms are also essential for the early detection and timely rectification of any accounting mismatches or deviations from regulatory norms. Banks should prioritize the adoption of consistent and transparent valuation methodologies for all derivative transactions, including internal hedging arrangements, with a preference for market-based valuations to provide a true and fair representation of their financial position and performance. 

Furthermore, the significance of sound risk management frameworks and strong governance practices within banking institutions cannot be overstated, as they are fundamental to maintaining investor confidence, ensuring financial stability, and fostering a culture of compliance. Looking ahead, the IndusInd Bank crisis is likely to result in heightened regulatory scrutiny and potentially more stringent regulations in the field of derivative accounting and risk management within the Indian banking sector, with the ultimate goal of strengthening the resilience and transparency of the entire financial system.
