  <p>I am Dr. Sudhanshu Pani, an Assistant Professor in the Department of Finance at the School of Business Management, NMIMS, Mumbai. With expertise in investment economics, I specialize in market microstructure, consumer finance, and capital markets, blending over 15 years of industry experience with academic research.</p>
  
  <p>My academic journey includes a PhD from NMIMS University (2016-2022), where I researched market microstructure of limit order markets (such as NASDAQ, NYSE), focusing on the information content of quotes and continuous auctions in order-driven markets. I also hold an MBA (Exe-PGP) from IIM Indore (2006-2008), where I graduated with first rank. I also graduated with honors in Metallurgy and Materials Engineering from Utkal University. My career spans roles at ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank, and Standard Chartered Bank, complemented by entrepreneurial ventures like Treta Fund.</p>
  
  <p>I am passionate about integrating theory and practice, contributing through publications such as <em>"On the quadratic variation in limit order markets"</em> (Borsa Istanbul Review, 2024) and books like <em>Consumer Finance â€“ Theory, Behaviour & Product Design</em> (2024). I teach courses like Consumer Finance and Corporate Finance, and conduct executive education for firms like ICICI Bank and L&T.</p>
